# LLM Fine-tuning: Impression Generation

## Objective

This project demonstrates proficiency in Large Language Models (LLM) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including model fine-tuning, text analysis, and data visualization, using the provided dataset.

## Assignment Overview

The main tasks include:

1. **Model Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune either the `gemma-7b-it` or `gemma-2b-it` model to generate impressions based on the given dataset.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the fine-tuned model using perplexity and ROUGE scores on a reserved evaluation dataset.
3. **Text Analysis**: Conduct a detailed analysis of the dataset to process and identify the top word pairs based on similarity.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations of the identified word pairs, including an optional interactive visualization.

## Model Fine-tuning

### Model Selection
- Chosen Model: `gemma-2b-it` (selected based on hardware capabilities).

### Training Process
- **Training Samples**: 300 samples from the dataset.
- **Evaluation Samples**: 30 samples reserved for evaluation.

### Fine-tuning Steps
1. Load the pre-trained `gemma-2b-it` model and tokenizer.
2. Prepare the dataset by organizing inputs and targets.
3. Fine-tune the model using the training samples.
4. Save the fine-tuned model for evaluation.

## Model Evaluation

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Perplexity**: A measure of how well the probability distribution predicted by the model aligns with the actual distribution of the evaluation samples.
- **ROUGE Score**: A set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of summaries generated by comparing them to reference summaries.

### Evaluation Process
1. Generate impressions using the fine-tuned model on the 30 evaluation samples.
2. Compute and report the perplexity and ROUGE scores.

## Text Analysis

### Analysis Steps
1. **Stop Words Removal**: Remove common stop words from the text.
2. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Apply stemming and lemmatization to the remaining words.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Convert the processed text into embeddings.
4. **Word Pair Identification**: Identify the top 100 pairs of words based on embedding similarity.

## Visualization

### Visualization Steps
1. Create visualizations of the top 100 word pairs identified in the text analysis.
2. **Bonus**: Develop an interactive visualization for exploring these word pairs.

## Deliverables

This repository contains the following:

- All source code used for model fine-tuning, evaluation, text analysis, and visualization.
